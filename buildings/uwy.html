  <h5>Info</h5>
  <p class="pad-text">The University YMCA Student Center is UW Tacoma's student recreation center. It is a fully operational YMCA, with
    recreation and fitness spaces, an NCAA regulation basketball court, cardio and weights equipment, indoor track,
    personal training, and locker rooms. Beyond the recreation center, the UWY serves as a social space for students
    too. Home to the Center for Student Involvement and student government, campus meeting and event spaces, and a game
    room, the UWY is a hub of student life at UW Tacoma.</p>
  <p class="pad-text">All current UW Tacoma students have full access to the University YMCA (and all locations of the YMCA of Pierce &
    Kitsap Counties) as part of their tuition and fees.</p>
